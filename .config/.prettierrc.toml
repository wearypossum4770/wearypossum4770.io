# Require Pragma
# When TRUE: Prettier can restrict itself to only format files that contain a 
# special comment, called a pragma, at the top of the file. This is 
# very useful when gradually transitioning large, unformatted codebases 
# to prettier. Add the following as the file's first comment.
# /***@prettier*/ or /***@format*/
requirePragma = false

# Insert Pragma
# When TRUE: Prettier can insert a special @format marker at the top of files 
# specifying that the file has been formatted with prettier.  If there 
# is already a docblock at the top of the file then this option will 
# add a newline to it with the @format marker.

#Prose Wrap
# By default, Prettier will wrap markdown text as-is since some services 
# use a linebreak-sensitive renderer, e.g. GitHub comment and BitBucket. 
# In some cases you may want to rely on editor/viewer soft wrapping 
# instead, so this option allows you to opt out with "never".
